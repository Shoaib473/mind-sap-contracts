# Mind SAP Smart Contracts

Smart Contracts for Mind Network Stealth Address Protocol

## Description

This repository contains the smart contracts for Mind Network Stealth Address Protocol. The stealth address protocol is a privacy-preserving technique in blockchain transactions that generates unique, one-time addresses for each transaction, making it challenging for external parties to track or analyze financial activity on the blockchain. In traditional blockchain transactions, wallet addresses are publicly visible, compromising user privacy. Stealth addresses aim to protect user identities and financial details by creating a "hidden mailbox" for on-chain assets.
